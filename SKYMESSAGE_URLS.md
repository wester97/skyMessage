## Usage Notes

1. **Apify Actor Config**: Copy the JSON array for each saint to the `START_URLS` environment variable
2. **License Compliance**: All sources above are either:
   - Public domain (New Advent)
   - Permitted use (Vatican)
   - Fair use for educational purposes (EWTN, Catholic Online)
3. **Attribution**: The scraper automatically stores publisher and sourceUrl in Firestore
4. **Rate Limiting**: Apify's Crawlee handles rate limiting automatically (20 requests max by default)

## Adding More Sources

When adding new URLs, prefer:
- Official Church sources (Vatican, diocesan sites)
- Public domain encyclopedias (New Advent, Catholic Encyclopedia)
- Reputable Catholic publishers (Franciscan Media, Paulist Press)

Avoid:
- Paywalled content
- Copyrighted modern biographies without permission
- Unreliable or non-authoritative sources
